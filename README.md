# Microservices Architecture for Language Model Project

## Overview

This project utilizes a microservices architecture to implement and manage a language model. The architecture is designed to facilitate inter-service communication, track machine learning experiments, manage model lifecycles, store artifacts, and monitor tasks. Below is a detailed explanation of each component and how they interact.

## MLflow CONFIG

If MLflow is failing to connect because the database `mlflow_db` does not exist, you need to create this database in your PostgreSQL instance.

### Create the `mlflow_db` Database:

1. Connect to your PostgreSQL server using a client like `psql` or any GUI tool.
2. Create the database `mlflow_db`:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE mlflow_db;
    ```
3. Ensure Correct Database Configuration: Verify that the MLflow configuration in your Docker Compose file or environment variables points to the correct database:
    ```yaml
    environment:
      - MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=postgresql://username:password@postgres/mlflow_db
    ```

## Full Steps

1. **Rebuild the Docker Images:**
    ```sh
    docker-compose build
    ```
2. **Create the `mlflow_db` Database:**
    - Connect to PostgreSQL and create the database:
    ```sh
    docker-compose exec postgres_airflow psql -U airflow
    CREATE DATABASE mlflow_db;
    ```
3. **Restart Services:**
    - Restart your Docker Compose services to apply the changes:
    ```sh
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

## Architecture Components

1. **Chat**
   - Purpose: Manages the user interface and processes user requests.
   - Connection: Sends user requests to the REST API for processing.
2. **REST API (FastAPI)**
   - Purpose: Provides inter-service communication between the components of the architecture.
   - Connection: Receives requests from the Chat service and forwards them to MLflow for model interactions and artifact handling.
3. **MLflow**
   - Purpose: Tracks machine learning experiments and manages the model lifecycle.
   - Connection: Receives data from REST API, interacts with Apache Airflow to orchestrate workflows, stores and retrieves artifacts from MinIO, and utilizes PostgreSQL for metadata storage.
4. **Apache Airflow**
   - Purpose: Orchestrates workflows and schedules tasks.
   - Connection: Schedules tasks through a dedicated Scheduler, provides monitoring through a Webserver, sends and receives performance metrics to and from Wandb.
5. **Scheduler & Webserver**
   - Purpose: These components are part of Apache Airflow.
   - Scheduler: Manages the timing of workflows.
   - Webserver: Provides a GUI for monitoring the scheduled tasks.
6. **Wandb**
   - Purpose: Tracks the visualization and performance of models.
   - Connection: Receives data from Apache Airflow to visualize task performance.
7. **MinIO**
   - Purpose: S3-compatible storage used for managing ML artifacts.
   - Connection: Stores artifacts generated or used by MLflow.
8. **PostgreSQL**
   - Purpose: Database used for storing metadata and operational data.
   - Connection: Stores experiment and model data for MLflow, maintains operational data for Apache Airflow.

## Suggestions for Improvement

- **Security:** Implement security measures like API gateways or OAuth to manage access to the services.
- **Scalability:** Consider container orchestration solutions like Kubernetes for better scalability and management of services.
- **Monitoring:** Integrate comprehensive monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana for better insight into service performance and health.
- **Bidirectional Data Flow:** Review and ensure that bidirectional data flows are necessary and optimized for performance.
